# Focal-Foods
This project was produced in the course Web Design with JavaScript and jQuery. The focus of the project was the coding, not the design. This grocery store website incorporates JavaScript and jQuery. The JavaScript is present in the navigation menu. When you select a food department, the sub-menu opens and will remain open until you select a category within it. With jQuery, food descriptions come in with the click of a button; this adds a level of interactivity. More jQuery interactivity is added on the recipes page where users can test themselves by hiding the recipes and memorizing the recipes before seeing them again.
